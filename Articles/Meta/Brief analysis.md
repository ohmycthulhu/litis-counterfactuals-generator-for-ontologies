## Explainable AI (XAI) A systematic meta-survey of current challenges and future opportunities
Source: [[Explainable AI (XAI) A systematic meta-survey of current challenges and future opportunities.pdf]]

It researches the current state of XAI, provides the potential research directions. 

The valuable points from the survey:
- the challenges in the existing XAI models/methods
- the advantages of analyzing models rather than data
- the importance to know when it is reasonable to incur additional costs for explanations.

It contains more than 150 articles in the references, it may be useful to check them.

**The important survey, should be used to extract knowledge and get more articles, in case we need it.**

## Explainable Machine Learning with Prior Knowledge
Source: [[Deep models/EXPLAINABLE MACHINE LEARNING WITH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE.pdf]]

*What is prior knowledge?*
Prior knowledge represent the context information, often indicating the importance of features and their relations.

*Is prior knowledge applicable to ontology-based models?*
It seems like the prior knowledge is represented by ontology's T-Box. The addition of other context information may be redundant (as we already have it).

## Explainable framework for meta-learning in automatic classification algorithm selection
Source: [[Deep models/Explainable framework for meta-learning in automatic classification algorithm selection.pdf]]

Question: why the framework is explainable and how the achieved it?

> A causal relationship between the features shows that changes in certain aspects induce changes in other features and that changes in the outcomes occur from the combined effect of both features

The explainable part is generation counterfactuals based on greedy algorithms with prioritizing certain features.
**I don't see the value for our research.**

The article explores the existing methods of incorporating Semantic Web with ML models in order to increase the latter's explainability.

*What is "knowledge matching"?*
> ... the matching of ML data with knowledge base entities ... knowledge matching

The existing articles provide manual way of knowledge matching. 

**The work is irrelevant due to absense of topics that we are interested in.**
