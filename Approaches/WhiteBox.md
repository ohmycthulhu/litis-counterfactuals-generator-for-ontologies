Source: [[CEO Counterfactual Explanations for Ontologies]]

White-box approach that parses the hierachies and relations, and act upon the differences between initial and desired class. 

### Questions?

- How do you create many counter-factuals?
- How to parse and get final asserions for the ontology?
- Which language may be useful here?
- Is there any other libraries to work with OWL ontologies?
- Is there any work that aimed at white-box approach to ontologies?

### Investigation

- Need exploring [OWL specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/)
- Maybe needs exploring [RDF specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/)
- It may be useful to check how protege calculates attributes and children ([source code](https://github.com/protegeproject/protege))
- Checking owlready code is advised ([source code](https://bitbucket.org/jibalamy/owlready2/))
