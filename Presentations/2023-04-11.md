The result of these three weeks:

- Metrics:
	- Confirmed the list of metrics
- Distances
	- Quality metrics are affected by the choice of similarity distance but it's out of scope of my work 
	- Learned about which distances exist for graphs and existing problems
	- Decided to not work on this area
- Search for ontologies:
	- Analyzed the list of ontologies
	- Found big ontologies that may become useful for testing: Plants, Duo, IAO
	- Describe how I chose which ontologies are usable
	- Decided to move with Pizza and Food & Wine ontology for now
- Proposed an alternative method for generating counterfactuals (combination of OntoDebug and CEO):
	- > Reusing the methods of finding potential changes for ontologies using OntoDebug's method, proposing potential changes using CEO, and evaluating the result using test case infrastructure.
	- Had tested the assumptions in the basis and found that the idea is not viable
- Explored OntoDebug on different ontologies:
	- It has bugs related to usage with inconsistent ontologies
	- The results are centered around changing the current individuals' properties, instead of assuming that they are immutable
	- OntoDebug is useful for debugging ontologies but it works well only with debugging T-Box
	- Usage of test cases requires reformulation of the desired class requirement, the usage with individuals are not possible
	- OntoDebug's assumptions 
- Explored CEO on different ontologies



The focuses of these weeks:
- learn more about distances
- search for big ontologies
- decide which ontologies should be used for development and evaluation
- explore OntoDebug and CEO usages
